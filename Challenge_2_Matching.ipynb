    "At the end of the Numpy102 notebook, I introduced the `searchsorted` function to do bisection searches on sorted arrays. The point of this challenge is to put that to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a function `match` that takes two integer arrays, `A` and `B`, and returns an array `M` of the same length as `A` that contains, for each element in `A`, the index of the element with the same value in `B`. If no match is found in `B`, the corresponding element of `M` should be `-1`. You can assume that values in `B` are unique.\n",
    "\n",
    "Demonstrate that your function works to match values (and detect non-matches) in an array `B` of size 100000 (you'll need to generate a unique array of 100000 integers to do that test).\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the `time` (or `%timeit`) functions to compare the performance of your `match` to a loop using `np.where` to match each item, for different combinations of `A` and `B` sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is not an easy challenge! The pay-off is that sooner or later you will probably need a routine like this (especially if you work with large N-body simulations!), and right now I don't know of a suitable package from anyone else (there may be one, so let me know if you find it)."
