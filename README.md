# Postgraduate Python Tutorial 2017/18

# Instructions

The tutorial is made up of a number of Jupyter notebooks to work through at
your own pace. The two afternoon classes are an opportunity to get started with
this and ask questions, but if you're completely new to Python there is more
material than we'll have time to work through in the classes.

The notebooks themselves and some supporting files are all in a
GitHub repository (currently https://github.com/apcooper/durham_phd_python).

[The wiki page for that
repository](https://github.com/apcooper/durham_phd_python/wiki) has some
background information (some of which will be given as slides in the classes)
and a description of the notebooks.

In the classes we'll use a local **JupyterHub Server** run by Daniel Maitre.

Log in with CIS username and password.

Click the `Released assignments` tab, ensure that `Course` is  `pyintro` and
choose `Fetch`. The notebooks for the course will be copied into a local
workspace so you can open and edit them.

Choose a notebook to work on from the list in `Downloaded assignments -> PyIntro`

Some read-only data files that are used in the tutorials can be found under `/data/pyintro/`.

In 2017 this course was given to Astronomy PhDs and included more
astronomy-specific material. We won't go through that in class.
